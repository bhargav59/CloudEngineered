# üöÇ Railway Free Tier Deployment Guide (AI Features Disabled)

## What's Optimized

This deployment configuration is optimized for **Railway's free tier** with:
- ‚úÖ Removed heavy AI/ML dependencies (torch, transformers, spacy, selenium)
- ‚úÖ Reduced Gunicorn workers (2 workers, 2 threads = 512MB RAM)
- ‚úÖ Faster build time (~3-5 minutes instead of 15-20 minutes)
- ‚úÖ All core features working (except AI-powered content generation)
- ‚úÖ Ready for production with your existing content

## What Works

‚úÖ **Full Website Functionality**:
- Homepage, About, Contact, Privacy, Terms pages
- Beautiful Tailwind CSS styling
- Admin panel for content management
- User authentication and profiles
- All static pages and templates

‚úÖ **Core Features**:
- Database with PostgreSQL
- Static file serving with WhiteNoise
- Secure HTTPS (Railway provides SSL)
- Production-ready settings
- Health checks and monitoring

‚úÖ **Payment & Monetization** (if configured):
- Stripe integration
- Premium tiers
- Consulting packages
- Report templates

## What's Disabled

‚ùå **AI-Powered Features**:
- OpenRouter API integration
- AI content generation
- Automated SEO optimization with AI
- GitHub monitoring with AI analysis

> **Note**: You can enable these later by upgrading to Railway Pro ($20/month) which allows longer build times and more resources.

## Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Verify Files Changed

```bash
cd /workspaces/CloudEngineered
git status
```

Should show:
- `Dockerfile` (modified)
- `start.sh` (modified)
- `requirements/base-minimal.txt` (new)
- `requirements/production-minimal.txt` (new)
- `.env.railway.template` (new)

### 2. Commit Changes

```bash
git add Dockerfile start.sh requirements/ .env.railway.template
git commit -m "üöÄ Optimize for Railway free tier - Remove AI dependencies

- Create minimal requirements without torch, transformers, spacy
- Reduce Gunicorn workers to 2 for memory optimization
- Add Railway free tier environment template
- Expected build time: 3-5 minutes
- Memory usage: ~512MB with 2 workers"

git push origin main
```

### 3. Railway Dashboard Setup

**A. Create Project**:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose `bhargav59/CloudEngineered`
5. Select `main` branch

**B. Add PostgreSQL Database**:
1. Click "+ New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
2. Wait for provisioning (~30 seconds)
3. `DATABASE_URL` is set automatically

**C. Set Environment Variables**:

Click on your web service ‚Üí Variables ‚Üí Raw Editor ‚Üí Paste:

```env
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production
DEBUG=False
AI_FEATURES_ENABLED=False
OPENROUTER_ENABLED=False
CELERY_ENABLED=False
GUNICORN_WORKERS=2
GUNICORN_THREADS=2
USE_S3=False
```

**D. Generate SECRET_KEY**:

In your local terminal:
```bash
python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
```

Copy output and add to Railway Variables:
```env
SECRET_KEY=<paste-your-generated-key>
```

**E. Set ALLOWED_HOSTS**:

After first deployment, Railway will show your domain (e.g., `cloudengineered-production-abc123.up.railway.app`).

Add to Variables:
```env
ALLOWED_HOSTS=cloudengineered-production-abc123.up.railway.app
```

### 4. Deploy and Monitor

**Watch Build Logs**:
- Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Click latest deployment ‚Üí View Logs

**Expected Build Output**:
```
‚úÖ Building Docker image...
‚úÖ Installing dependencies from production-minimal.txt
‚úÖ Build completed in 3-5 minutes
‚úÖ Starting application...
üìç Using PORT: 8000
‚úÖ Database connected successfully!
‚úÖ Migrations completed successfully
‚úÖ Static files collected
üöÄ Starting Gunicorn server...
üìä Workers: 2, Threads per worker: 2
‚úÖ Deployment successful
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

**Test URLs**:
```bash
# Homepage
https://your-app.up.railway.app/

# Admin panel
https://your-app.up.railway.app/admin/
Username: admin
Password: admin123

# Health check
https://your-app.up.railway.app/health/

# API (if enabled)
https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Change admin password immediately after first login!

- **CPU**: Shared vCPU
- **Disk**: 1GB
- **Build Time**: 10 minutes max
- **Uptime**: $5 credit/month (~500 hours)

**Your Configuration**:
- **Expected RAM**: ~400-500MB (2 workers √ó 2 threads)
- **Expected Build Time**: 3-5 minutes
- **Expected Disk**: ~300MB (no AI models)
- **Expected Monthly Cost**: $0 (within free credit)

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failed - Timeout
**Cause**: Shouldn't happen with minimal dependencies (3-5 min build)

**Solution**: Check Railway logs for specific package failures

### 502 Bad Gateway
**Cause**: Application not binding to PORT

**Solution**: 
1. Check logs for `üìç Using PORT: <number>`
2. Verify Gunicorn started successfully

### Out of Memory
**Cause**: 2 workers using >512MB RAM

**Solution**: Set in Railway Variables:
```env
GUNICORN_WORKERS=1
GUNICORN_THREADS=2
```
This reduces to 1 worker (better for very low RAM).

### Static Files Not Loading
**Cause**: WhiteNoise not configured or collectstatic failed

**Solution**:
1. Check logs for "‚úÖ Static files collected"
2. Verify `whitenoise` in `requirements/production-minimal.txt`
3. Restart deployment

### Database Connection Failed
**Cause**: PostgreSQL not provisioned or URL missing

**Solution**:
1. Verify PostgreSQL plugin is added
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` is set automatically by Railway
3. Restart deployment

## Upgrading to Enable AI Features

When you're ready to upgrade to Railway Pro ($20/month):

1. **Update requirements**:
```bash
# In Dockerfile, change:
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements/production.txt
# (instead of production-minimal.txt)
```

2. **Enable AI features**:
```env
AI_FEATURES_ENABLED=True
OPENROUTER_ENABLED=True
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key
```

3. **Increase resources**:
```env
GUNICORN_WORKERS=4
GUNICORN_THREADS=2
```

4. **Set build timeout**: Railway Pro allows 30+ minute builds
